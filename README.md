# Frontend Developer By Day, Music Nerd By Night.

:zap: I work mainly with React, JavaScript and Tailwind.  
:mortar_board: I'm currently learning NodeJS and the very basics of backend development.  
:mega: You can see my weekly progress and achievements every friday at [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomas-pereira-dev/).  
:cd: What am I listening lately? Dynamo by Soda Stereo, a shoegaze cult classic.

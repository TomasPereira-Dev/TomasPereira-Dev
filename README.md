<h1 align="center">Hi, TomÃ¡s here :)</h1>
I'm a frontend dev, with a passion for helping people with their coding questions.
I love to get my hands dirty and build things, even if i don't know nothing about what I'm doing!

### About me

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, JavaScript and how to have good taste with web design.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m a very active Frontend Mentor user, helping other people with their projects giving feedback and asking their questions.
- âš¡ Fun fact: (most of) my projects have a ReadMe explaining how did I done it and the process of the making for other people to read and learn.

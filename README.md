<h1 align="center">Hi, Tomás here :)</h1>
I'm a frontend dev, with a passion for helping people with their coding questions.
I love to get my hands dirty and build things, even if i don't know nothing about what I'm doing!

### About me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning unit testing with Vitest and how to have good taste with web design.
